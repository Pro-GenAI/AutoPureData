#### Why AutoPureData?
LLMs (Generative AI) like ChatGPT do not have the latest updated information.
The reason for not auto-updating with the latest data is a lot of unsafe or unwanted text around the web.

This project is to automatically collect the data and filter unwanted text using AI and LLMs.
The auto-filtered data can be used to automatically update knowledge of LLMs.


#### _What are filtered:_
- **Unsafe content** :biohazard:: Toxic, threat, insult, discrimination, political, self-harm,
	religious, violence, sexual, profanity, flirtation, spam, scam, misleading, and more
- **Content from unreliable sources** :newspaper:: Unsafe websites and unindexed domains (that are not crawled by search engines)
- **Personal details** :bust_in_silhouette:: Phone, address, credit card, SSN, IP address, and more
- **Attacks** :shield:: Adversarial attack attempts (with Data Poisoning)

Languages supported: Only English for now (more languages will be added when contributors are available)

```


## :rocket: Quick Start
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env
```
Now, edit the `.env` file and add your API keys. <br>
Run the file [Data_flagging.ipynb](Data_flagging.ipynb)
	to collect and filter the latest web data.
Run the file [Analytics_and_Filtering.ipynb](Analytics_and_Filtering.ipynb)
	to manually correct the flagging.

After the filtering process, the data can be used with an LLM as mentioned in [Usage_with_LLMs.ipynb](Usage_with_LLMs.ipynb)
- This file pushes the filtered data to Pinecone DB and uses it with an LLM.
